# Presto Benchto benchmarks

The Benchto benchmarks utilize [Benchto](https://github.com/prestodb/benchto) benchmarking
utility to do macro benchmarking of Presto. As opposed to micro benchmarking which exercises
a class or a small, coherent set of classes, macro benchmarks done with Benchto use Presto
end-to-end, by accessing it through its API (usually with `presto-jdbc`), executing queries,
measuring time and gathering various metrics.

## Benchmarking suites

Even though benchmarks exercise Presto end-to-end, a single benchmark cannot use all Presto
features. Therefore benchmarks are organized in suites, like:

* *tpch* - queries closely following the [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/) benchmark 
* *tpcds* - queries closely following the [TPC-DS](http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/) benchmark 

## Usage

### Requirements

* Presto already installed on the target environment
* Basic understanding of Benchto [components and architecture](https://github.com/prestodb/benchto)
* Benchto service [configured and running](https://github.com/prestodb/benchto/tree/master/benchto-service)
* An environment [defined in Benchto service](https://github.com/prestodb/benchto/tree/master/benchto-service#creating-environment)

### Configuring benchmarks

Benchto driver needs to know two things: what benchmark is to be run and what environment
it is to be run on. For the purpose of the following example, we will use `tpch` benchmark
and Presto server running at `localhost:8080`, with Benchto service running at `localhost:8081`.

Benchto driver uses Sprint Boot to locate environment configuration file, so to pass the
configuration. To continue with our example, one needs to place an `application-presto-devenv.yaml`
file in the current directory (i.e. the directory from which the benchmark will be invoked),
with the following content:

```yaml
benchmark-service:
  url: http://localhost:8081

data-sources:
  presto:
    url: jdbc:presto://localhost:8080
    username: na
    password: na
    driver-class-name: com.facebook.presto.jdbc.PrestoDriver

environment:
  name: PRESTO-DEVENV

presto:
  url: http://localhost:8080

benchmark:
  feature:
    presto:
      metrics.collection.enabled: true

macros:
  sleep-4s:
    command: echo "Sleeping for 4s" && sleep 4
      
```

### Configuring overrides file

It is possible to override benchmark variables with benchto-driver overrides feature.
This is useful for instance when one wants to use different number of benchmark
runs or different underlying schemas. Create a simple `overrides.yaml` file:

```yaml
runs: 10
tpch_medium: tpcds_10gb_txt
```

### Running benchto-driver

With the scene set up as in the previous section, the benchmark can be run with:
```bash
./mvnw clean package -pl presto-benchto-benchmarks
java -Xmx1g -jar presto-benchto-benchmarks/target/presto-benchto-benchmarks-*-executable.jar \
    --sql presto-benchto-benchmarks/src/main/resources/sql \
    --benchmarks presto-benchto-benchmarks/src/main/resources/benchmarks \
    --activeBenchmarks=presto/tpch --profile=presto-devenv \
    --overrides overrides.yaml
```
