.. note::

  Running :command:`ktadd` randomizes the principal's keys. If you have just
  created the principal, this does not matter. If the principal already exists,
  and if existing users or services rely on being able to authenticate using a
  password or a keytab, use the ``-norandkey`` option to :command:`ktadd`.
