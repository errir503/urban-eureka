Kerberos Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need a Kerberos :abbr:`KDC (Key Distribution Center)` running on a
node that the |subject_node| can reach over the network. The KDC is
responsible for authenticating principals and issuing session keys that can be
used with Kerberos-enabled services. KDCs typically run on port 88, which is
the IANA-assigned port for Kerberos.
